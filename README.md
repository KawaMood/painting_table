# **Painting Table**

**Craft custom Players Heads!**

A crafting station that allows you to craft custom player heads.  
A survival-friendly way to decorate your world with little blocks!

# ü™Ñ Introduction
## What is Painting Table ?

Painting Table introduces a survival and multiplayer-friendly way to craft custom player heads, with any kind of textures. Players heads are appreciated to mimic custom small blocks, like small logs, small stones, food, animals, chests, pile of books, bags, etc.

## How to obtain and use a painting table?

**Painting tables** is an item that can be bought from a mason villager for 8 emeralds.  
This custom offer will automatically be added to all masons reaching the expert level.

After you bought it, you can simply place down your **painting table**.  
The block has its own UI that shows its requirements.

In order to craft custom **players heads**, the painting table except **blue**, **red** and **yellow dyes**, along with **blocks of quartz** that will be consumed as soon as you take the output items.

The last item to put is a **writable book**, that won't be consumed.  
In this same book, you need to paste the value of the desired player heads textures.  
In this example below, I set a [a cake player head texture](https://minecraft-heads.com/custom-heads/head/51324-cake) in the writable book.

You can find many players heads textures on the [minecraft-heads.com](https://minecraft-heads.com/) website. In the "Custom Heads" section, search for a head you like, and click on it to open its relative full page. Then, scroll to the `For developers` > `Value` field, and click the `Copy` button. Paste the result in your writable book in the game.

I recommend you to watch the [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/dnZcRcQgk8E) for more direct explanation and examples. 

## Misc. information about painting tables

- Like for other crafting station, painting tables return input items the player set in it when it closes it.
- For technical reasons, you can't put a hopper, dropper, crafter adjenctly to a painting table, or a hopper minecart below it. These blocks will also be rotated automatically to not face it.

If you are an operator of your server or if cheats are enabled in your single-player world, you can give yourself a painting table using these following commands:
```
/function pk_painting_table:cmd/give

# üßπ Uninstall

Painting Table comes with an automatic uninstallation process. Running it will:
- Remove all painting tables that have been placed in your world, in every dimensions
- Remove all scores and storage specific to the Painting Table data pack
- If there is no more KawaMood data packs installed, also remove all common scores and storages
- Unfortunately it won't remove the relative offer from mason villagers who already have it. This would be to heavy to track and store their position. You can however do it manually, by going close to them and running this command for each of them individually, before running the uninstall process:
```
/function pk_painting_table:cmd/debug/remove_offers_from_nearest_villager
```
The command to start the uninstalling process is the following one: 
```
/function pk_painting_table:cmd/uninstall
```
The uninstalling process may take some seconds to complete. Be sure to wait for the message telling you that you can safely remove the data pack from your world's folder before doing it. 

# ‚ùì F.A.Q

<details>
<summary>Do I need to install a resources pack?</summary>

No, this data pack doesn't involve any resources pack.
</details>
<details>
<summary>The texture of the item shows regular player heads, how can I fix that?</summary>

You need to be connected to the internet the first time you craft and place a painting table. The textures of the player heads that are used to create their looks are indeed loaded and cached on the client-side, from (old or current) players skins that are stored on a Mojang server.

If you accidentally used a content that required to be online the first time you use it, and now see regular players heads instead of the expected texture, you can still go in the ".minecraft/assets/skins/" folder, then sort the sub-folders by date, and delete some recent folders. Once that is done, if your game was already started, you will need to restart it to update the cached content.
